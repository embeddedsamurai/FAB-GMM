# FAB-GMM
GMM-FAB estimates Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameter based on Factorized Asymptotic Bayes (FAB) algorithm. 
The FAB algorithm is similar to the conventional expecation-maximization algorithm for fitting GMM but allows automatic estimation of the numbers of mixture components based on Factorized Information Criteria (FIC).

## Requirements
